The following text briefly describes the equation of state (EOS) files found
in this directory and how to read them.  These files, also available
on the AAS CD-ROM Vol. 5, are meant to accompany Saumon, Chabrier and
Van Horn (1995, hereafter, SCVH) and provide complete equations of state
for hydrogen and helium.  Equations of state for mixtures of hydrogen
and helium can be obtained by compositional interpolation as described
in SCVH.  This set of files includes only the so-called "interpolated EOS"
for hydrogen. Tables related to the Plasma Phase Transition, whose use is not
adviseable, are not included.  See SCVH for details.

1)  DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES

There are seven ASCII files to copy:

   File name               Contents

1) README_I             This text file.  Basic information on the tables.
2) READ.F               Short FORTRAN program which reads the above tables 
                        (shows the format of the tables)
3) H_TAB_I.A            Interpolated hydrogen EOS table  2.10 < log T < 7.06
4) HE_TAB_I.A           Interpolated helium EOS table  2.10 < log T < 7.06
 
These files occupy about 800 Kbytes of disk space.
Files 3 is for the hydrogen EOS, and the last one is for helium.
Both equations of state are based on the free energy minimization method. 
The Helmholtz free energy model for hydrogen is fully described in Saumon and 
Chabrier (1991; 1992) and Chabrier (1990).  The model for the helium EOS is 
found in SCVH.  The latter paper also shows both equations of state in graphic 
form (thermodynamic surfaces), contains a critique of the present equations 
of state, and compares these calculations with other EOS commonly used in 
astrophysics.

2) CONTENT OF THE EOS TABLES

The equations of state are tabulated along isotherms.  As an example, these are 
the first ten lines of H_TAB_I.A:

The first line gives log T (K) and the number of pressure points along that 
isotherm.  The lowest value of the pressure is log P = 4, and it increases in 
steps of 0.2 for all isotherms, but the maximum pressure is not the same for 
all isotherms (see Figs 18 and 20 of SCVH).  Note that the (log T, log P) 
coverage of H_TAB_I.A and HE_TAB_I.A are identical.  Each row then provides:

log P:                P is the pressure in dyn/cm**2. 
X(H2):                The number concentration of H2 molecules (He atoms for 
                      helium).
X(H):                 The number concentration of H atoms (He+ ions for helium).
log rho:              rho is the mass density in g/cm**3.
log S:                S is the entropy in erg/g/K.
log U:                U is the internal energy in erg/g.  The zero point of 
                      energy is the ground state of the H2 molecule for 
                      hydrogen, and the ground state of the He atom for helium. 
d log rho/d log T|P:  Logarithmic derivative of the density with respect to the 
                      temperature at constant P.
d log rho/d log P|T:  Logarithmic derivative of the density with respect to the 
                      pressure at constant T.
d log S/d log T|P:    Logarithmic derivative of the entropy with respect to the 
                      temperature at constant P.
d log S/d log P|T:    Logarithmic derivative of the entropy with respect to the 
                      pressure at constant T.
d log T/d log P|S     The adiabatic gradient.

All logarithms are in base 10.  The contribution from the photon gas is NOT 
included.


3) TYPOS

There are a few typographical errors in the equations
of the Saumon, Chabrier & Van Horn (1995) EOS paper.

In Eqns (45) and (46), the ratios S/S^H and S/S^{He} should read
S^H/S and S^{He}/S, respectively.

In Eq (56), the numerical factor should be 2/3, not 3/2.

The latter affects the calculation of the contribution of the electrons
to the ideal entropy of mixing.  In practice, this
matters only when the gas is ~ fully ionized, where the ideal entropy of
mixing is only a rough approximation of the actual entropy of mixing,
except in the high temperature, low density limit.  The latter should
not be of much concern to applications of this EOS to stellar and
planetary interiors.
